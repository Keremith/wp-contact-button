# WhatsApp Contact Button Plugin

This WordPress plugin allows you to add an easily accessible and stylish WhatsApp contact button to your website. Thanks to this button, users can contact you via WhatsApp with a single click. If you want, you can activate the message forwarding setting from the administration panel.

## Use

After activating the plugin, you can configure the plugin from the settings page in your WordPress control panel. Please include your contact number in the box without spaces. Otherwise, the button will not redirect to WhatsApp as you want.

## Thanks

My first WordPress plugin, thank you in advance if anyone downloads it.
